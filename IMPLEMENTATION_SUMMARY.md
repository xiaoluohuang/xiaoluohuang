### Model Architecture

```
Total Parameters: 18,282,881 (69.74 MB)
Trainable Parameters: 18,280,961
Non-trainable Parameters: 1,920

Layer Structure:
1. Conv1D (64 filters, kernel=11) → BatchNorm → SELU → AvgPool
2. Conv1D (128 filters, kernel=11) → BatchNorm → SELU → AvgPool
3. Conv1D (256 filters, kernel=11) → BatchNorm → SELU → AvgPool
4. Conv1D (512 filters, kernel=11) → BatchNorm → SELU → AvgPool
5. Flatten → Dense(512) → SELU → Dropout(0.5)
6. Dense(256) → SELU → Dropout(0.3)
7. Dense(1) → Sigmoid
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
1. Load CSV files (1000 rows × 201 columns each)
2. Transpose: columns → samples, rows → features
3. Split: First 160 samples for training, next 40 for testing
4. Normalize: Divide by 256
5. Reshape: Add channel dimension (samples, features, 1)
6. Shuffle: Random permutation of training and test sets
```
